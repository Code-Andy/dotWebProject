# dotWebProject

A simple application that is built around a self-crafted survey and asks users 20+ questions about their mental health. From here it determines the severity of the user's anxiety, stress, and depressions levels and assigns a colour for each mental health issue. The darker the colour the more severe the issue is for that person. After the user signs up, their location is saved in the Firebase database where it is used to create a heatmap style diagram to showcase where students feel the most stressed, depressed or anxious in our local community. From here data can be derived and patterns can be made.
